        <h3>How the Prediction Works</h3>
        <p>This tool uses a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger would have survived the Titanic disaster, based on several key features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fare:</strong> Higher fares generally correspond to higher-class passengers, who had better access to lifeboats and other survival resources.</li>
            <li><strong>Sex:</strong> Women and children had higher survival rates compared to men, as lifeboats were often prioritized for them during the evacuation.</li>
            <li><strong>Age:</strong> Younger passengers, especially children, had higher chances of survival due to the "women and children first" evacuation priority.</li>
            <li><strong>Pclass:</strong> First-class passengers were more likely to survive, as they were closer to the lifeboats and had better access to safety measures.</li>
            <li><strong>Family Size:</strong> Passengers traveling alone had different survival chances compared to those with family members, who were more likely to stay together during the evacuation. Larger family sizes sometimes meant better survival chances due to mutual support.</li>
            <li><strong>IsAlone:</strong> Passengers traveling alone faced more challenges, as they didn't have family support during the chaos of the evacuation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By entering the details about a passenger's journey, this model analyzes the relationship between these features and their survival rate, helping to estimate whether they would have survived the Titanic disaster.</p>
